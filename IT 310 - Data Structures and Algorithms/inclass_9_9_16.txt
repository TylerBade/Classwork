Tyler Bade

1) Multiple choice
	1) C: Time and Space
	2) A: Counting microseconds (B: Counting the number of key operations)
	3) A: Counting the maximum memory needed by the algorithm
	4) D: Null Case
	5) D: Item is the last element in the array or is not there at all
	6) A: When the item is somewhere in he middle of the array
	7) A: Much more complicated to analyze than that of worst case
	8) A: For relatively permanent collections of data
	9) C: Both of the above (A: by this way computer can keep track only the the address of the first element and the addresses of other elements can be calculated.)
	10) D: All of the above

2) True/False (Why?)
	1) True, abstracted methods are usually included with what they do, but not how they're implemented
	2) True
	3) True, it allows for a hierarchy with a superclass heading different subclasses
	4) False, an iterative approach will go through every possible item till it finds a match or gets to the end
	5) True, if a function doesn't have a base case, it will continue on to infinity
	6) True, undo button and browser back button are only a few cases
	7) True, binary searches will split its search in half based on where the current iteration is
	8) True, arrays must be imported in order to be used
	9) True, without modification, arrays cannot be lengthened or shortened.
	10) True, a list object is dynamic in python

3) Consider the program
	a) 1
	b) 3
	c) This function will check to see whether or not the number A can be divided by number B to make a whole number
	   and if it can, it will return the divisor, otherwise, it will take the divisor and divide it by the remainder.
