5: In inorder notation: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16

	8
    4	    12
  3   6   10  14
       7       16

6:
	7
    4       12
  3   6   10  14
		16

7: Binary tree: a tree like sturcture in which each parent node has two child nodes
Complete binary tree: Each level has all of its nodes (except the bottom level)
Full Binary tree: every node other than the leaves have two children

8: 2^n where n is the level

9: 2^(n+1) - 1 where n is the depth

12: In a tree being traversed in preorder notation where the leaves are
the integers and the parents are the operators

ex: Tree equals 23
	+
    *	    /
  5   4   6   2
