This repository is specifically for holding my past classwork, and code that I have done. Having already completed my coursework, there's quite a bit of it. If you decide to use any of my, I ask that at the very least, type it in yourself, I typed every character, and believe me, its better for learning.

Repositories for some of my other classes are under the groups that I've contributed to, like my Software Engineering class. While I may not have a folder for it in my repository (yet), I still have some work to show for it.

Whatever you use it for, I am not responsible for the consequences of it, you know the rules and the consequences of breaking them, and I don't control you.
